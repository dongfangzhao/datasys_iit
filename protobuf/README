Objective
To test the compatibility between C and C++ for serialization

Prerequisite
1. Install Google Protocol Buffer (GPB) from here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
2. Install the C binding of GPB from here: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/

Files
1. pbc_test.c: pack data to a file; unpack a file to data
2. pbcpp_test.cpp: same as above
3. metac.proto/meta.proto: the structure of data

Compilation
1. Generate the C header/source for packing: protoc-c metac.proto --c_out=./ 
2. Generate the C++ header/source for packing: proto meta.proto --cpp_out=./
3. Followed the header comments of pbc_test.c and pbcpp_test.cpp. You may need to comment out the second half of each file to make sure the files are generated before trying to read.
