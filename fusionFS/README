TODO:
	*[important]Support remote rename
		- Add service to ffsnetd `rename file`, or other design?
	*[important]how to select and maintain replica nodes
	
Note:
    *If you make your desktop run ffsnetd service, please make sure no firewall is blocking this service from outside request.
		- In Fedora, you can turn off firewall by `sudo service iptables stop`
		- Note that there's no firewall inside IBM Bluegene
