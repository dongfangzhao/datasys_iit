How to use fusionfs:
	1) Make sure all dependent libraries are installed and specified, e.g. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
	:/usr/local/lib:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src
	2) ./start_service to start the backup services
	3) ./compile to install fusionfs
	4) ./start to run fusionfs
	5) ./stop to stop fusionfs
	6) ./stop_service to stop all services
	7) `rm -rf fusion_root/*` to cleanup your playground
	8) `rm -rf src/udt4_c/ffsnet/ffsroot/*` to cleanup the physical file repository

Update history:
	07/17/2012: remote file removal supported and tested on two nodes
	07/16/2012: all one-node test cases have passed over two nodes - Fedora and Fusion.
	07/15/2012: started testing on single node (test_plan.txt added): directory passed; files on root directory passed 
	07/09/2012: clean up the warnings
	07/05/2012: hsearch replaced by ZHT
  	06/27/2012: read with UDT
	06/01/2012: read/write with LFTP
	05/22/2012: read/write with SCP

TODO:
	*Support remote rename
		- Add service to ffsnetd `rename file`
	*Update ZHT for new _lookup() signature and return code
	*Move zht_() functions out of fusionfs.c

Question:
	*If we support hierarchical directory on physical file system, then there must be multiple
	copies of the same directory over multiple nodes. So do we need to effectively remove these
	physical (empty) directories?
