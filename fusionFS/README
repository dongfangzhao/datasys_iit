How to use fusionfs:
	1) Make sure all dependent libraries are installed and specified, e.g. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
	:/usr/local/lib:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src
	2) ./start_service to start the backup services
	3) ./compile to install fusionfs
	4) ./start to run fusionfs
	5) ./stop to stop fusionfs
	6) ./stop_service to stop all services
	7) `rm -rf fusion_root/*` to cleanup your playground

TODO:
	*Support directory hierarchy on physical node
		- Add two services to ffsnetd: `create dir` and `remove dir`
		- Whenever a directory is modified in ZHT, the initiator should call the above service(s)
	*Support strict consistency for remote file removal
		- Add one service to ffsnetd: `remove file`
		- Whenever a file is removed from a ZHT, the initiator should make a request to the (remote) node to remove the physical file as well
	*Support remote rename
		- Add service to ffsnetd `rename file`
