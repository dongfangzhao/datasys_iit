How to use fusionfs:
	1) Make sure all dependent libraries are installed and specified, e.g. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
	:/usr/local/lib:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src
	2) ./start_service to start the backup services
	3) ./compile to install fusionfs
	4) ./start to run fusionfs
	5) ./stop to stop fusionfs
	6) ./stop_service to stop all services
	7) `rm -rf fusion_root/*` to cleanup your playground

TODO:

	*[important]Restructured code and simplified Makefile	
		- Move zht_() functions out of fusionfs.c
	*[important]Support remote rename
		- Add service to ffsnetd `rename file`, or other design?
	*[important]how to select and maintain replica nodes
	
Note:
    *If you make your desktop run ffsnetd service, please make sure no firewall is blocking this service from outside request.
		- In Fedora, you can turn off firewall by `sudo service iptables stop`
		- Note that there's no firewall in Bluegene
