Update history:
  	06/27/2012: read with UDT
	06/01/2012: read/write with LFTP
	05/22/2012: read/write with SCP

To use UDT-based file transfer, you need to setup the an environment variable to import all the depedent libraries:
export $LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:../src:./udt4_c/ffsnet:./udt4_c/src:./src/udt4_c/ffsnet:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src

The wrapper of C++ libraries to C programs have some warning issues, which is fine for now. E.g.: 
fusionfs.c:122:2: warning: implicit declaration of function "ffs_recvfile_c" [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
