How to use fusionfs:
1) Make sure all dependent libraries are installed and specified, e.g. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
:/usr/local/lib:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src
2) ./start_service to start the backup services
3) ./compile to install fusionfs
4) ./start to run fusionfs
5) ./stop to stop fusionfs

To use UDT-based file transfer, you need to setup the an environment variable to import all the depedent libraries before you make the program:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4_c/src

The wrapper of C++ libraries to C programs have some warning issues, which is fine for now. E.g.: 
fusionfs.c:122:2: warning: implicit declaration of function "ffs_recvfile_c" [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
