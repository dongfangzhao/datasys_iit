This is an example to show how to call ffsnet C++ methods from a C file.

The deamon process (ffsnetd.cpp) on the server, and the C++ library source code (ffsnet.cpp and ffsnet.h) are the same as before as in the ffsnet directory.

There is a wrapper (ffsnet_bridger.cpp) to interpret the incoming C calls and redirect these requests to the ffsnet C++ library.

The new test file is written in C, i.e. ffsnet_test_c.c

The header comment of each source file explains how to compile with dynamic library (shared objects)
